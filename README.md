<p><strong>Note:</strong> PyFEA is currently in the early stages of development and will evolve significantly over the course of the next few months.</p>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>PyFEA is built to be an extendable suite for FE analysis in python, as this is a work in progress, no real documentation is currently provided but examples will be added to the examples folder as they are created. 
The focus will be on explicit FEM applied to transient simulations (and therefore will support steady-state, albeit at a maybe larger computation time).</p>

<h2 id="current-progress">Current progress</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Interface with the <a href="https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/blob/master/api/gmsh.py">gmsh api</a> for meshing</li>
  <li>Interface with <a href="https://github.com/pyvista/tetgen/tree/master/tetgen">tetgen</a> for meshing (some issues, but basic functionality exists)</li>
  <li>Generating meshes from STP files</li>
  <li>Generating meshes from STL files</li>
</ul>
