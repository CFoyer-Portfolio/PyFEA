# PyFEA

Christophe Foyer 2019 | [www.cfoyer.com](https://www.cfoyer.com)

__Note:__ PyFEA is currently in the early stages of development and will evolve significantly over the course of the next few months.

## About
PyFEA is built to be an extendable suite for FE analysis in python, as this is a work in progress, no real documentation is currently provided but examples will be added to the examples folder as they are created. 
The focus will be on explicit FEM applied to transient simulations (and therefore will support steady-state, albeit at a maybe larger computational time).

## Current progress
- Interface with the [gmsh api](https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/blob/master/api/gmsh.py) for meshing
- Interface with [tetgen](https://github.com/pyvista/tetgen/tree/master/tetgen) for meshing (basic functionality only)
- Generating meshes from STP and STL files

## To Do
- [Done]~~Improve neighboring cell finder performance~~
- [In progress] Create easy way to interact with elements and set up multi-sim problems
- Support multiphysics extensions
- Support netgen for meshing
- Fix interface (outer faces) between entitymeshes in assemblies

## Dependencies
### Required:
- numpy
- pyvista
- tensorflow
- [gmsh](https://gmsh.info/)

### Optional:
- Interfaces with [AeroSandbox](https://github.com/peterdsharpe/AeroSandbox) (WIP)
- [tetgen](https://github.com/pyvista/tetgen/tree/master/tetgen) (currently inferior to gmsh)
