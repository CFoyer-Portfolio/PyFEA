__Note:__ This is still very much a work in progress and will evolve significantly over the course of the next few months

## About
A start to setting up a coherent library for FEA using python. 
Hoping to make this somewhat pleasant to use eventually, and to model a few things using the mesh.

## Current progress
- Interface with the [gmsh api](https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/blob/master/api/gmsh.py) directly (for better support)
- Generating meshes from STP files
- Generating meshes from STL files

## To Do
- Efficiently order data to support irregular/sparse matrices (ideally with numpy compatibility)
- Create easy way to interact with elements and set up multi-sim problems
